;;; Commentary:

;; Run `compile'-style shell commands inside a ghostel terminal
;; buffer.  Unlike \\[compile] (which runs commands through comint),
;; `ghostel-compile' runs them in a real TTY via ghostel so programs
;; that detect a terminal (progress bars, colours, curses tools)
;; behave as they would in an interactive shell.
;;
;; The buffer mimics `compilation-mode': a "Compilation started at"
;; header, a "Compilation finished at ..., duration ..." footer (with
;; the same plain-text format and duration formula `M-x compile'
;; uses), and surrounding shell prompts are hidden so only the
;; command's own output is visible.  `mode-line-process' reflects
;; run/exit state with the same faces `M-x compile' uses.
;;
;; When the command finishes, the live shell and ghostel renderer are
;; torn down and the buffer's major mode is switched to
;; `ghostel-compile-view-mode' (derived from `compilation-mode').  At
;; that point the buffer is a regular, read-only Emacs buffer with
;; standard error highlighting and `next-error' navigation.  It will
;; not return to an interactive ghostel terminal — a recompile (`g',
;; `M-x ghostel-recompile') discards it and starts fresh in the
;; original `default-directory'.
;;
;; Completion is detected via the OSC 133 D semantic prompt marker,
;; so shell integration (`ghostel-shell-integration') must be
;; enabled — bundled bash, zsh and fish scripts emit those markers
;; automatically.  `ghostel-compile-debug' logs every OSC 133 C/D
;; event and the finalize call to *Messages* for diagnostics.
;;
;; Standard `compile' options honoured:
;;   `compile-command' / `compile-history' (shared with \\[compile])
;;   `compilation-read-command'
;;   `compilation-ask-about-save'
;;   `compilation-auto-jump-to-first-error'
;;   `compilation-finish-functions' (runs alongside
;;     `ghostel-compile-finish-functions')
;;   `compilation-scroll-output' (effectively always on)
;;
;; Keys in the finished buffer:
;;   g           — ghostel-recompile
;;   n / p       — compilation-next-error / -previous-error (no auto-open)
;;   RET         — compile-goto-error (open the source)
;;   M-g n / M-g p — standard `next-error' / `previous-error'

Like \\[compile], but uses a ghostel buffer so programs that require
a real TTY work correctly.  The buffer gets a compilation-mode-like
header and footer, surrounding prompts are hidden, and when the
command finishes (detected via the OSC 133 D semantic prompt marker)
the major mode is switched to `ghostel-compile-finished-major-mode'

`compilation-mode').  Error locations become available through
`next-error'.

Output always scrolls as it arrives (equivalent to
`compilation-scroll-output' being non-nil).  `compilation-ask-about-save'
and `compilation-auto-jump-to-first-error' are honoured.  The command
default and history are shared with \\[compile] via `compile-command'
